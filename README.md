# 🚀 FastAPI Project Setup Guide

This guide will help you get the FastAPI server up and running using [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a modern Python package manager and runtime.

---

## 📦 Step 1: Install `uv`

If you don't already have `uv` installed, you can install it with one of the following methods:

### MacOS / Linux

```bash
curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
```

Alternatively, check out the [official uv installation docs](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation) for more options.

---

## 🧪 Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment and Run the App

```bash
uv run main.py
```

> This will automatically create a `.venv` folder for your project if one doesn't already exist.

---

## 📥 Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using:

```bash
uv add -r requirements.txt
```

This installs everything listed in `requirements.txt` and locks them using `uv.lock` for reproducibility.

---

## 🖥️ Step 4: Run the Server
### Start the Server
Start the FastAPI development server to run your server:

```bash
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

---

### Access the API 
Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Or hold `Cmd` (Mac) or `Ctrl` (Windows/Linux) and click the link in your terminal.

## Step 5: 🔐 Configure Environment Variables

We use a `.env` file to manage configuration, like database URLs. See `.env.example` to get started.

## 🧱 Step 6. Database & Model Setup

We're using [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (PostgreSQL) as our database.

- SQLModel handles our models
- Supabase manages the DB and connection pooling
- Environment variables are loaded from `.env` (see `.env.example`)

For example, the `providers` table includes automatic timestamp tracking:

```commandline
from sqlmodel import SQLModel, Field, Column, DateTime, text
created_at: Optional[datetime] = Field(
        default=None,
        sa_column=Column(DateTime(timezone=True),
        server_default=text("(now() AT TIME ZONE 'utc')")
        )
    )
```
This ensures timestamps are generated by Postgres itself (not Python), guaranteeing accuracy and consistency in UTC. See commit [fix: user server defaults for created_at and updated_at](https://github.com/dsd-cohort-team-corgi/backend/pull/18/commits/7f8b3211a259705534fdfaba86f0591c07e0caee) for implementation details.

### ✅ You're Ready!

You can now build and test your FastAPI backend locally. Happy coding!


## Notes

### Add Dependencies
```
uv add dependency name
```
### Remove Dependences
```
uv pip uninstall package-name
uv remove package-name
uv sync
```

# üöÄ FastAPI Project Setup Guide

This guide will help you get the FastAPI server up and running using [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a modern Python package manager and runtime.

---

## üì¶ Step 1: Install `uv`

If you don't already have `uv` installed, you can install it with one of the following methods:

### MacOS / Linux

```bash
curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
```

Alternatively, check out the [official uv installation docs](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation) for more options.

---

## üß™ Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment and Run the App

```bash
uv run app/main.py
```

> This will automatically create a `.venv` folder for your project if one doesn't already exist.

---

## üì• Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using:

```bash
uv add -r requirements.txt
```

This installs everything listed in `requirements.txt` and locks them using `uv.lock` for reproducibility.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Step 4: Run the Server
### Start the Server
Start the FastAPI development server to run your server:

```bash
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

---

### Access the API 
Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Or hold `Cmd` (Mac) or `Ctrl` (Windows/Linux) and click the link in your terminal.

### üìö Access the API Docs (Swagger UI)

Once the server is running, FastAPI auto-generates interactive API docs at:
- Swagger UI: [`http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
- ReDoc: [`http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc)

#### To test an endpoint:
1. Go to `/docs`
2. Scroll to the endpoint you want to test
3. Click on it to expand
4. Click the "Try it out" button on the right
5. Enter any required parameters
6. Click "Execute"
7. Scroll down to view the response from the server

_This is super helpful during development to verify everything is working as expected._

## Step 5: üîê Configure Environment Variables

We use a `.env` file to manage configuration, like database URLs.
1. Go to **Supabase > Database > Connect**
  * ![img.png](app/img/img.png)

2. In the modal that appears, look for the **Direct Connection** section at the top:
  * ![img_1.png](app/img/img_1.png)

3. Use the `.env_example` file as a template to create your own `.env`.

4. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable using:
    - The **DB password**
    - The **hostname** shown under **Direct Connection**

## üß± Step 6. Database & Model Setup

We're using [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (PostgreSQL) as our database.

- We define our database tables using `SQLModel`, a library that makes it easy to work with both Python data and SQL databases.
- Supabase hosts our Postgres database and helps manage performance behind the scenes.
- Settings like the database URL are stored in a `.env` file (as seen in the previous step).

### ‚è±Ô∏è TimestampMixin

We've taken common fields like `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` and moved them into a reusable class called `TimestampMixin`.

This helps keep our models cleaner and avoids repeating the same code in every table.

```python
class TimestampMixin(SQLModel):
    id: Optional[uuid.UUID] = Field(default_factory=uuid4, primary_key=True)
    created_at: Optional[datetime] = Field(
        default=None,
        sa_column=Column(
            DateTime(timezone=True),
            server_default=text("(now() AT TIME ZONE 'utc')")
        )
    )
    updated_at: Optional[datetime] = Field(
        default=None,
        sa_column=Column(
            DateTime(timezone=True),
            server_default=text("(now() AT TIME ZONE 'utc')")
        )
    )
```

## üß™ [Optional] Seed the Database
To test your database connection or seed example data (e.g. into the `providers` table), you can run the following:

```
uv run test_db.py
```

### ‚úÖ You're Ready!

You can now build and test your FastAPI backend locally. Happy coding!

## üß∞ Dependency Management

### Add Dependencies
```
uv add dependency name
```
### Remove Dependencies
```
uv pip uninstall package-name
uv remove package-name
uv sync
```

---
## üßØ Troubleshooting

### Can't connect to Supabase?

If you're seeing errors like:

```
psycopg2.OperationalError: could not translate host name ...
```

Make sure your internet connection isn't blocking access to Supabase's cloud database.

We've seen cases where **some Wi-Fi networks block or throttle access**, especially on public or secured networks. If you're stuck:

- Try switching to a mobile hotspot
- Check your firewall or DNS settings
- Make sure `.env` is loading the correct `DATABASE_URL` (i.e. print the string)
